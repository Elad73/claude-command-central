# Project Status

Last updated: 2026-04-23

## Current Phase

**MVP locked — preparing for public release as an open-source utility.** The TypeScript + Ink + React (web) dashboard tails Claude Code hook events from multiple projects simultaneously. Build is green, 98 tests pass, four projects currently wired into the registry, git initialized on `main`. This session is a documentation + hardening pass to make the repo clone-and-activate for other developers.

## What's running

- **`ccc serve`** on `localhost:7777` — Fastify server streaming SSE from all registered feeds, serving a Vite-built web dashboard.
- **`ccc watch`** — the original Ink TUI, still wired and functional.
- **`ccc init`** — idempotent hook installer; writes `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, **`SubagentStart`**, `SubagentStop`, `Stop` hook templates into a target project's `.claude/settings.json` with a `# ccc-hook` marker so it's safe to re-run and preserves user-authored hooks.
- **`ccc emit --from-hook`** — reads Claude Code hook stdin, translates to events, never fails loud.

## Registered projects

See `~/.claude-command-central/projects.json`. Currently: `claude-command-central`, `gmail-board`, `daily-logger`, `expense-tracker`.

## Recently completed (post-MVP)

- **Subagent team visibility** — `SubagentStart` / `SubagentStop` hooks emit a dedicated agent card per subagent using `agent_type` as the name and auto-routing to a phase based on the subagent's role (`*-reviewer` → REVIEW, `*-test*` → TEST, `*-architect`/`explore` → PLAN, etc.). Each teammate shows up in the office under its own name.
- **Humanized task text** — bash commands and tool calls are translated into plain English for the thought bubbles (e.g. `npm test` → "Running tests", `git commit` → "Committing"), while the Live Feed keeps the raw technical text.
- **Per-project agent colors** — agents wear their project color (hex-stable short codes like `CCC`, `GB`, `DL`); rooms keep their phase color for identity.
- **Room occupancy lamps** — four corner lamps light only when at least one live agent is in the room; fade when the room is empty or only has resting agents.
- **Resting-agent dim state** — `done`/`idle` agents drop glow + opacity + all loops, so finished teammates read as clearly inactive.
- **Theatrical per-room scenes** (`web/src/components/scenes/*`) — each phase has its own animation:
  - INTAKE: agents walk lanes carrying trays from pallet to receiving table.
  - STRATEGY: seated at planner's desks with lamps, pen sweeps + ponder cycle.
  - BUILD: hash-picked tool per agent (hammer / saw / drill / paint), tool rack on back wall.
  - REVIEW: Sherlock in a wingback armchair, fireplace, deerstalker, magnifier + pipe with smoke.
  - TEST: stunt-fall from ceiling hatch into safety-cushion stack, splash → sprawl → stand → thumbs-up.
  - DEPLOY: launch pad + parabolic rocket arc to a pulsing star, box offloaded, returns, stack grows.
- **Mission Strip** — per-project mission cards under the Pipeline showing each project's current objective + team size (live / total). Agent bubbles stay tactical; this strip answers "what are they trying to accomplish?".
- **Resizable, collapsible Live Feed** — drag the left edge to widen/narrow; click `›` to collapse to a thin rail. Width + collapse state persist in `localStorage`. Project chips in the feed use compact short codes.
- **Warm-up button** — one click runs a demo agent through every room sequentially so you can verify animations + lamp cycling without needing a real session.
- **Hook debug sidecar** — `CCC_HOOK_DEBUG=1` env var tees raw hook payloads to `~/.claude-command-central/hook-debug.jsonl` for future investigations.
- **Cleanup pass** — dead `Task`-tool branches removed from `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse` (Claude Code doesn't fire those hooks for `Agent`/`Task`). Unused `chokidar` dep removed. Data entries pruned. 98/98 tests green.

## Open blockers / decisions

- None. The dashboard is observing live sessions across four projects.

## Next up

- **Bounded event history ring buffer** with a replay scrubber.
- **Per-project tab filtering** in the dashboard (currently all projects share one office).
- **Sparkline widgets** for per-room throughput.
- **Distribution** — publish to npm as `claude-command-central` so install becomes `npm install -g` instead of `npm link`.

## Quick reference

```bash
# From this repo
npm install && npm run build && npm link

# In any target project
cd ~/your-project
ccc init                                               # one-time — installs hooks
ccc serve                                              # web dashboard on :7777
# or
ccc watch --feed ~/.claude-command-central/feeds/your-project.jsonl   # Ink TUI
```

- Tests: 98 across 11 files (`npm test`)
- Build: tsup + vite → `dist/` + `web/dist/` → copied to `dist/web/` for bundled serve
- CLI entry: `dist/bin.js`
- Config override: `CCC_CONFIG_DIR=/custom/path`
- Hook debug: `CCC_HOOK_DEBUG=1`

## Tech stack

Node 20+, TypeScript 6 (strict, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`), Ink 7 + React 19 (TUI), Vite + React 19 + Tailwind 4 + framer-motion (web), Commander 14, Zod 4, Fastify 5 + `@fastify/static` + `@fastify/cors`, Vitest 4. Tsup for the CLI build.
